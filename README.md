kaboom
======

Kaboom is a chrome extension I made to help a friend survive a crappy job. He was tasked with scanning oodles of LinkedIn search results, without the aid of a paid recruiting LinkedIn account. With kaboom, he could load a bunch of results, and then click the button, and any search results that contained disqualifying keywords would disappear from the list, often bringing it down from 25 results to just 1 or 2 per page. 

It was mostly a fun excuse to figure out how to make an extension, but it did make his life a bit easier til he ultimately quit that job. :)
